# Pytorch DL Tutorial For Students

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook called TUTORIAL.ipynb that shows how to train a deep learning model in PyTorch to classify dog breeds. The notebook uses the ResNet-18 architecture and is trained on a subset of Stanford Dogs Dataset which contains 120 breeds of dogs.

## Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
See requirements.txt for required libraries

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your_username/pytorch-dog-breed-classifier.git`
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dogs.zip file from this repository and extract it into the project directory (if on Windows, otherwise the notebook will extract it for you).

4. Start Jupyter Notebook and open the TUTORIAL.ipynb file
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the model.
